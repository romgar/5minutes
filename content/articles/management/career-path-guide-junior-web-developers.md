Summary: You are a junior web developer and you currently don't know much about the industry? You want to know what is important to learn? You want to prepare your technical knowledge to have the best chances in your career? I tell you everything I would have loved to know when I started mine.
Status: Draft

You just started a job as web developer, and there seem to be a lot to learn. You feel a bit lost between [frontend](), [backend](), [devops](), ..., what they mean and what you should start doing.
Another article will cover the different roles, but let's assume that for now, you decided to follow a specific path (which could be one in particular, or a mix of them, depending on the role/company you are joining).

I would like to share some insights on what you should really care about when you start.

# What you should care about

## #1 Focus on one technology at a time

There are lots and lots of langages / frameworks / libraries out there, and that's really easy to spend _a lot_ of time just thinking which one to choose.
When you are looking for your first job, the langage doesn't matter much. If you want to have the most opportunities for the future, pick a technology that is quite common.

The [roadmap.sh website](https://roadmap.so) is a gold mine in terms of information on what to learn for [frontend developers](https://roadmap.so/frontend), [backend developers](https://roadmap.so/backend) or [devops](https://roadmap.so/devops).
It gives you a path that helps you focus on things one at a time. I highly encourage you to have a deep look there, but not necessarily to understand what each step is for.

As the section title mentions, "focus on one technology at a time"

## #2 Understand the technologies you are using

Understanding a specific piece of tech (language, framework, library) takes a lot of time. Following the initial tutorial and making it work is really far from understanding why this tech has been created and how it works.
You need to spend a significant amount of time understanding what are the strengths and weaknesses of the tools you are using. That will build your tech ecosystem knowledge and allow you to explain why you chose one technology against another one.

## #3 Understand the business context

Not enough to just take a ticket.
Should challenge solutions.

## #4 Have senior developers to learn from

While the sensation of having to write a software from scratch from the beginning, that's definitely not a fast way to learn if you are all by yourself.
Senior developers are a great source of insights to get shortcuts in your learnings: they will make you better developers, better thinkers, faster than if you had to learn everything your way.
They will also help you getting more focused on the concepts that matter, as well as helping you getting things done.

## #5 Work in an environment with a classic web stack

It would be great that you learn from the beginning in an environment that has a classic web stack, compared to really "niche" technologies.
That would allow you to be able to reuse as much as possible what you learnt.
The classic technologies are again quoted in the [roadmap.sh website](https://roadmap.so). While something not listed here is not necessarily a bad choice, be aware that the choices you will have later will be reduced.
There are also website like [stackshare.io](https://stackshare.io) that list the tech stack from a lot of different companies. Interesting to see what is going there.

## #6 Be in an healthy dev environment

That's quite close to the previous point, but instead of focusing on technology aspects, you should also start learning from a web software engineering process. It should include:

- Testing (unit-testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, ...),
- Code reviewing,
- Continuous integration (the tests, as well as other steps, are automatically triggered after your code changes),
- Continuous deployment (your code is deployed in production directly if it passes the continuous integration step).

If the environment you are currently working in does not have these elements, that's worth challenging your tech leader(s) to understand the reasons.

## #7 Be in a company with a good culture

Use your coach / mentor / project lead / other devs

## #8 Take initiatives early in your career

We have a tendancy to always want to be better and consider that we are never good enough for a job, that a bit more experience would be beneficial.

# The motto

"Time is your most precious resource. Use it wisely."
