Summary: Using keepdb with TransactionTestCase in Django test suite
Status: draft

Few days ago, I had several issues with some data (from migrations) that were no more in my database after running tests,
even with `--keepdb` option.
Let's see what happened.

Database tests cleaning
---

First, let's summarise how database test cleaning is working in Django.

TestCase
---
If you inherit from TestCase, each test you are writing is wrapped in a transaction (and since Django 1.9, there is also
a transaction wrapping all tests, which makes setUpClass and tearDownClass really useful, specially for test speed).
It means, for each test:

Before: database in state A,
During: you can change some data in your database, which will be in state B,
After: there is a rollback that brings you back to state A.

Neat.

TransactionTestCase
---
If you need to test some specific database behaviours (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/testing/tools/#django.test.TransactionTestCase),
you may need to use a TransactionTestCase, that is no more wrapping each test in a transaction.
What happens for each test is:

Before: database in state A,
During: you can change some data in your database, which will be in state B,
After: all tables are emptied (TRUNCATE), your database is in state Z (Zero data).

But then, what happens if you have 2 `TransactionTestCase` that need the same state A ?
The second one will be run with an empty database, which is maybe not what you wanted.

Solution: serialized_rollback option
---
To be sure that your `TransactionTestCase` are not dependent from each others, you can use `serialised_rollback = True` option.

If you use it, at the beginning (`SetUp` step) of each test, Django will load the data coming from initial migrations.
How ? Django is serializing these initial data, and loading them if you ask it.

What will happens then is:

Database initial state: A

First TransactionTestCase with `serialized_rollback = True`:

Pre-setup db state: A
SetUp step: loading initial data -> db in state A (unchanged)
Test: some data created -> db in state B
TearDown step: flushing everything, db in state Z

Second TransactionTestCase with `serialized_rollback = True`:

Pre-setup db state: Z (cleaned by previous TransactionTestCase)
SetUp step: loading initial data -> db in state A
Test: some data created -> db in state B
TearDown step: flushing everything, db in state Z

Nice !

But there are still some issues, even with this option.

Contraints errors
---
If you are working with Django 1.7.x/1.8.x, you have maybe encountered this error 'IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "django_content_type_app_label_<some_hex>_uniq"'
There is a StackOverflow thread about that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29226869/django-transactiontestcase-with-rollback-emulation/35359897 that I recommand you to read carefully.

A patch has been created and shipped with django 1.9.x (https://github.com/django/django/commit/d3fdaf907db6a5be4d0391532d7e65688c19e851)
But if, like me, you can't really afford to work on latest stable version of Django, you can add a setting
`TEST_NON_SERIALIZED_APPS = ['django.contrib.contenttypes']`

Database empty at the end of the test run suite, even with --keepdb option
---
If you want to keep the database for future tests with â€”keepdb option, the last TransactionTestCase run will still delete all the data in the database.
There is an opened ticket related to that issue: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25251

Finally, after all these tests, I can keep my TransactionTestCase tests and my data are still in the database \o/
