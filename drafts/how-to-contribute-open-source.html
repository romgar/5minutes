</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Have you already asked yourself one day "The open-source spirit is amazing, I really want to contribute,
where should I start..." ?</p>
<h1>StackOverflow's random picking style</h1>
<p>You can begin to spend your time on stack overflow and try to answer unresolved questions.</p>
<h2>Impact on the community: 8/10</h2>
<p>stackoverflow is our google, if you answer it, a LOT of people will benefit it).</p>
<h2>Impact on you: 1/10</h2>
<p>You will spent a LOT of time to pick questions that are completely unrelated, you will have to switch
the context, and maybe will want to answer some that are not in your area of skills.
Having different skills is nice, completely sparse ones it less nice.</p>
<h1>Try to contribute on a massive project</h1>
<p>Let's take Django as an example, and you want to pick some unassigned tickets.</p>
<h2>Impact on the community: 5/10</h2>
<p>if you contribute on a popular project like this one, still a lot of people will be
able to use what you have improved/fixed.</p>
<h2>Impact on you: 5/10</h2>
<p>Diving into a big project can be time consuming, and you will spend a lot of time to learn in deep a VERY small part of it.</p>
<h1>Share your improvements</h1>
<p>Let's say that you are working on a little library. You have seen a bug, fixed it locally to make it work with your project.</p>
<h2>Impact on the community: 2/10</h2>
<p>This library is probably quite small, but that's still better than nothing.</p>
<h2>Impact on you: 10/10</h2>
<p>You have not spent any extra time to resolve a problem you were not concerned about, other people will be able to use it.</p>
<h1>My experience</h1>
<p>I was in the third situation, was using a little library named <code>django-dirtyfields</code>. I needed a functionality that was
missing, added it and then decided to create a MR (<link>).</p>
