</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Ok, we decided for the big jump and start a career path discussion!</p>
<p>From there, we can roughly be in 3 situations:
They don't know at all where they want to be in 5 years (80%),
They have a gist of where they are heading to (10%)
They have a plan (10%)</p>
<h2>They don't know</h2>
<p>That's the interesting bit, where we can add the most value.
The first step is to understand why they don't know:
They have never thought about it before (that raises an important point: before initiating a career discussion, some time should be allowed for the person to think about it. There is no way that somebody will come with a relevant plan on the fly),
They have thought about it, but it's so hard that they didn't progress much,
They don't believe that's possible to have an interesting discussion about this topic, too many uncertainties in life (in this case you have to convince them to at least give it a try with you and see how it goes)</p>
<p>Depending on their current experience, the discussion will be different (see the different guides to have more content available).
A really good source of insight is job boards. What better than the market can give you what the market wants.
As that's a well known fact that most of the job ads are "profiles" descriptions</p>
